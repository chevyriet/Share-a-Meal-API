## About the API

The Share-A-Meal API is an API that could support an application by offering functionality like creating, sharing, editing and deleting meals, with users also being able to participate in these meals (and remove themselves) and make use of these [**'CRUD'**](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD) functionalities.

Not only do the meals use these CRUD functionalities, the users do aswell (The API makes sure they only perform these CRUD functionalities on themselves, which we'll get into later).

Users are also able to login to their account after registering themselves, which gives them access to a big part of the functionality of the API. This is all made possible by using [jwt](https://jwt.io/introduction), who provide secure **jsonwebtokens**, handling a secure authentication.
